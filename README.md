## Introduction

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** repository. This project is dedicated to documenting and understanding the critical phase of **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It serves as a foundation for the Airbnb clone project, guiding us to define, analyze, and validate user and system requirements clearly and systematically.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It forms the foundation for all future development activities by defining what the system should do and under what constraints.

This process ensures alignment between business goals and technical solutions and serves as a benchmark for validating the system’s performance. It allows the development team to understand user needs, avoid misunderstandings, and measure the success of the software.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase of the SDLC because:

- **Clarity and Alignment**: It creates a shared understanding among stakeholders, developers, and users regarding what the system should achieve.
- **Scope Definition**: It clearly defines the project scope, helping to prevent scope creep and avoid unplanned feature additions.
- **Time and Cost Estimation**: It enables more accurate estimates of the resources, time, and budget needed for successful project delivery.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis process typically involves the following five key activities:

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting initial requirements from stakeholders and users using techniques such as interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and observation.
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Refining and expanding on gathered requirements through methods like brainstorming, focus groups, and workshops to uncover the deeper needs.
- **Requirement Documentation**: Structuring and documenting the requirements using formats such as the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), user personas, and use case diagrams.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Prioritizing requirements and creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, user stories, process flows) to visualize and interpret the requirements.
- **Requirement Validation**: Verifying and validating the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure completeness, consistency, and feasibility.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define what the system should do—its specific behaviors, tasks, and functions.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**

- A user can search for available listings.
- A host can create, edit, or delete a property listing.
- A user can book a listing and make a payment.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs its functions—qualities such as performance, usability, reliability, and scalability.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**

- The system should respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
- The platform should support at least 10,000 concurrent users.
- All user data should be encrypted at rest and in transit.

## Use Case Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** represent the functional interactions between users (actors) and the system. They provide a high-level visualization of system functionalities.

**Benefits:**

- Simplifies understanding of system behavior.
- Clarifies roles and responsibilities.
- Helps identify functional requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are predefined conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by stakeholders. They serve as a clear, measurable basis for validating features and determining when a feature is complete.

**Importance:**

- Ensures mutual understanding between developers and stakeholders.
- Provides objective benchmarks for testing and validation.
- Helps avoid misunderstandings and rework.

**Example: Checkout Feature in Booking Management System**

- The user must be logged in to access the checkout page.
- The checkout page must display booking details, total cost, and payment options.
- The system should confirm the booking with a unique reference ID upon successful payment.
- If payment fails, the system should notify the user and provide retry options.

This documentation will evolve throughout the project lifecycle to ensure we maintain a shared understanding of requirements and expectations. Let's build a successful Airbnb clone grounded in solid requirement analysis!
